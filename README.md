# John Carters TTM Squeeze with MACD

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) that combines John Carters TTM Squeeze indicator with the MACD indicator. The TTM Squeeze indicator detects market volatility and potential breakouts, while the MACD indicator provides trend confirmation. The indicator can be used to generate buy and sell signals based on market breakouts.

## Functionality

The code consists of several functions:

### Custom indicator initialization function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. It attaches the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators to the chart and sets their parameters.

### Custom indicator iteration function

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new bar on the chart. It calculates the TTM Squeeze and MACD values for each bar and stores them in buffers.

### Custom trading functions

The `IsMarketBreakout()` function checks if the TTM Squeeze indicator signals a potential market breakout based on the previous and current values.

The `GenerateBuySignal()` and `GenerateSellSignal()` functions generate buy and sell signals when a market breakout occurs. These functions can be customized to place buy and sell orders with specific parameters, such as stop-loss and take-profit levels.

### Custom error handling and debugging functions

The `HandleError()` function handles errors and displays appropriate error messages.

The `Debug()` function prints debug messages for troubleshooting purposes.

### Custom testing and validation functions

The `TestAndValidate()` function conducts thorough testing using historical data and compares the results with manual analysis.

### Custom code maintenance and support functions

The `MaintainAndSupport()` function provides ongoing support for bug fixes and updates. It also adapts the code to any changes in the trading environment.
